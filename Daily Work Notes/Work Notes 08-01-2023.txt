Vagrant is an automation tool which uses Hypervisor to create the VM using the Vagrant images/boxes from the vagrant cloud with the codes
from the CLI.

- To automate the VM installation while Multi-VM setup
- In Vagrant there are No OS installations and we set up VM using Vagrant images which are called as Vagrant Boxes
- These are ready made virtual machines which are available in vagrant cloud
- All configuration changes or any other VM changes can be done through the Vagrant File
- We can execute scripts and commands in Vagrant to power off/ create / delete etc.

Vagrant Commands:

vagrant init geerlingguy/centos7 	Vagrant init 'Vagrant images or Boxes for VM'
vagrant up				To create a VM using hypervisor if not exists or to start the existing VM
vagrant ssh				To Login into the VM using ssh (Has to be in the directory of that vagrant box)
vagrant halt				To power off the VM running in the Hypervisor
