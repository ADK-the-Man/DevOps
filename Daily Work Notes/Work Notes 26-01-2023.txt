								Package Management

tree is the basic command in software management to view the tree structure of a directory path.

curl (short for "Client URL") is a command line tool that enables data transfer over various network protocols. It communicates with a web or application server by specifying a relevant 
URL and the data that need to be sent or received.

>>curl https://rpmfind.net/linux/centos/7.9.2009/os/x86_64/Packages/tree-1.6.0-10.el7.x86_64.rpm -o tree-1.6.0-10.el7.x86_64.html
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 47508  100 47508    0     0  35618      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 35613

This finds the link and -o will generates and stores the output of the webpage result in the name as given in the end.

This is basically done whenever you want to install or download anything in the VM.

Once after downloading to install the tree, 

>> rpm -ivh package_name

i - install
v - verbose (The verbose option specifies that you want to display detailed processing information on your screen)
h - Human Readable Format

This command will show the installtion process in a human readable format.

RPM is the Red-HAt package manager to install/uninstall the packages

RPM doesn't install dependenices so while installing any pckage with dependenices we have install them seperately.

YUM resolves this conflict, yum install dependeicnes that are required for the current package automatically.

>> yum install package_name
Example : yum install httpd

>>yum remove httpd

Review Process once--!!


To archieve we use TAR and ZIP

>>tar -xzvf jenkins_djsdks.tar.gz

>>tar -xzvf jenkins_name.tar.gz -C /opt/

Like Yum for Redhat machine we have dpkg for debian machines
